# JuliaPractice

- Very light Julia practice in preperation for my UT Dallas work this summer.
- Trying to implement graphing; following Julia's documentation: https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/tutorial/
- Work in progress! Will try to get higher level calculus graphs to better visualize more complex data.
